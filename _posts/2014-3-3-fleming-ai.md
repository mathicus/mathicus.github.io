## Registering a domain name
I had already chosen a name for my company before the top level domain .ai became available.  AI is the abbreviation for Anguilla, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean..

The registrar, https://www.onlydomains.com/, made it easy to register the name when it became available. The name had been parked for a couple of years but I'm glad I registered if when I did. AI is hot right now.
