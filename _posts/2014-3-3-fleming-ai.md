## Registering a domain name
I had already chosen a name for my company before the top level domain .ai became available.  AI is the abbreviation for Anguilla, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean..

The registrar, https://www.onlydomains.com/, made it easy to register the name when it became available. The name had been parked for a couple of years but I'm glad I registered if when I did. AI is hot right now.

## GitHub Pages
https://pages.github.com/

There are many ways to host a web site but GitHub Pages has turned out to be the most simple and cheap way to do it.
Your site is hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.

### Using GitHub Preview
If you need a web server to render an HTML file you can use [GitHub & BitBucket HTML Preview](GitHub & BitBucket HTML Previewhttps://github.com/htmlpreview/htmlpreview.github.com). 

## Jekyll Now
[Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

Jekyll is a static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed on the site, and more.
